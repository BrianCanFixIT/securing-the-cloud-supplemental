# Small Scale Policy Linting

In this lab you will try out the policy linter "Parliament" and observe some of the findings.

# Lab Instructions

1. Navigate in a web browser to https://parliament.summitroute.com/

2. Go and visit the "UnfederatedAdministrator" role inside the AWS console.  Select a custom policy we've created at random and paste the JSON into parliament.  Observe some of the findings.  

3. Try and address one or more of the findings in the YAML.  Then update the CloudFormation stack that created that role ( from earlier in the course )

You may note that this is a great UI but the strategy doesn't scale very well.
