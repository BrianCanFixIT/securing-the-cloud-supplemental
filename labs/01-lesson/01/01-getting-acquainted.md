# Get Acquainted With AWS

Technically there's no lab for this section.  But you would be well served to do 
one of two things during the class.

1. If you are an AWS Customer figure out which AWS Services you are using.  The easiest
way is to get a copy of your bill and start reading through it.  Knowing your services
is half the battle in making a threat model.

2. If you are not an AWS Customer spend some time coming up to speed on the core services
and their use cases.  You can check out `/r/aws` on reddit, follow @quinnypig on twitter, or
subscribe to a podcast like Screaming in the Cloud.  Start listening, absorbing, and understanding the services available out there.

Feel free as well to look at the AWS Console features for customizing the top NAV bar with shortcuts.  Keep in mind though these are stored in a cookie.  So time spent here is about as useful as your browser history.

## Take it Low and Slow

Like a good pot roast ( whether you're cooking in a pressure cooker or not ) the best 
way to familiarize yourself is to steep in AWS for a time.  Let the material sink in.  Don't worry if it seems a bit overwhelming at first.
