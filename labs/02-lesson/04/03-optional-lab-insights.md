# Play with CloudWatch Log Insights

This lab is optional because you may already have a 
metrics and monitoring platform.  Cloudwatch Log Insights 
is relatively new but can product exciting graphs.

## Lab Instructions

1. In the account that has your system logs and flow logs sign into the web console and use the cheat sheet of insights queries within `supplemental/02-04` to query.

2. Do you think this could be useful in a security incident?  Why or why not?  Post your feedback in the Discord channel.
